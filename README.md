Encryption and Decryption TooL

This is a simple Python GUI application built with Tkinter that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using Base64 encoding. The tool provides a basic level of security by requiring a password to access the encryption and decryption features.

# Features:
- *Base64 Encryption:* Convert your plain text messages into encoded text using Base64 encoding.
- *Base64 Decryption:* Decode Base64-encoded messages back to their original form.
- *Password Protection:* A basic password (1234) is required to perform encryption and decryption operations.
- *User-Friendly Interface:* Simple and intuitive GUI for easy text encryption and decryption.
- *Reset Functionality:* Quickly reset the text input and password fields to start fresh.

# How to Use:
1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the provided text box.
2. Enter the password (1234) to unlock the encryption or decryption process.
3. Click the *ENCRYPT* button to encode the message or the *DECRYPT* button to decode it.
4. Use the *RESET* button to clear all inputs.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
# Notes:
- The password is currently hard-coded as 1234 for demonstration purposes. For more secure usage, consider modifying the code to allow custom passwords or implementing more robust encryption methods like AES.

# Future Improvements:
- Enhance security by implementing stronger encryption algorithms.
- Allow users to set their own passwords.
- Add functionality to encrypt/decrypt text files.
